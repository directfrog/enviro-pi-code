Stuffed cabbage – Trôo style,"['1.5-2kg/3lb 5oz-4lb 8oz Savoy, white or green cabbage , thickly shredded', '50g butter', '800g fabulous butchers sausages , or Duchy Originals, skinned']","Pre-heat the oven to 150C/Gas 2/fan 130C. Cook the cabbage in boiling salted water for 4 minutes or so, then drain and run under the cold tap. Drain again thoroughly. Butter a deepish oven-proof dish (about 3 litre) generously with half the butter. Cover the base with a third of the cabbage. Season well.
Arrange half the sausagemeat over the cabbage, flattening it out a bit with your fingers so that it covers it reasonably well, pressing down as you go. Repeat these layers, and then finish with a final layer of cabbage. Season again with salt and pepper, then dot with the remaining butter. Cover tightly and bake for 21⁄2 hours, until the cabbage is as tender as butter."
