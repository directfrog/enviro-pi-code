#before running this remember to download the following libraries. just a note, it is HARD to do that. i ahd to watch a goddamn video in Hindi which happened to be the only one on the problem. so yup, just message or call me.


#function takes string as parameter
def say(text):
	engine = pyttsx3.init()
  #function then says the string
	engine.say(text)
	engine.runAndWait()
 

# obtain audio from the microphone
def listen():
  #creates a speech recog object
	r = sr.Recognizer()
	with sr.Microphone() as source:
	    print("Say something!")
      #listens.....
	    audio = r.listen(source)
      #This is the cool part. it takes what it hears and puts it into a string
	    return r.recognize_sphinx(audio)


text = listen()
print(text)
